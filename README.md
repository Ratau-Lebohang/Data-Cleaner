# Data Cleaner 
A data cleaning tool for preparing datasets before analysis or modeling.  
It ensures **quality, consistency, and readiness** of data for advanced analytics and machine learning workflows.  

---

## Purpose of Each Cleaning Step

- **Missing Values**: Handle gaps in data to prevent analysis errors and improve model accuracy  
- **Duplicates**: Remove redundant records that skew results and model training  
- **Format Standardization**: Ensure consistency for correct parsing and downstream processing  
- **Text Normalization**: Improve text clarity and recognition for analytics & NLP tasks  
- **Outlier Handling**: Manage extreme values to avoid distortions in statistical measures  
- **Categorical Encoding**: Convert text categories to numeric form for machine learning models  
- **Schema Enforcement**: Maintain consistent data types and structure across the dataset

## Outcome
By applying these cleaning actions, the dataset becomes:  
- **Consistent** in formatting  
- **Complete** with no critical missing values  
- **Structured** for seamless integration into analysis pipelines  
- **Ready** for machine learning workflows
